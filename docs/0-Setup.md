## Workshop setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this lab you need a [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts), if you don't have one no worries, you can create a personal account for free. Create your account in the [GitHub sign up page](https://github.com/signup).

### Create your repository

Let's create the repository you'll use for your workshop.

> [!TIP]
> Clicking on links in the instruction manual will open a browser tab on the host machine. This is fine for things like reviewing reference documents, but for the next step you'll want to interact directly with the browser in the VM.

1. Within the lab environment, open Edge and navigate to the template repository: `https://github.com/GuacamoleResearch/managing-work`. ***TODO - UPDATE TEMPLATE***
2. Click the **Sign in** button on the top-right of the page and complete the sign-in process.
3. Click **Use this template** > **Create a new repository** green buttons on the top-right of the page.
4. Under "Owner" select the owner specified by your workshop leader or the organization you'll use.
5. Under "Repository", set the name as specified by your workshop leader, or an appropriate name for your self-study.
6. You can accept defaults for the rest of this form; click the **Create repository** button on the bottom of the form.

In a few moments a new repository will be created from the template for this workshop!
